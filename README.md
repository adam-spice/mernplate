<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/screenshot.png" alt="Logo" width="50%" height="50%">
</p>

I am just starting out as a developer and found that during my day to day learning I was writing the same code
over and over again. So, I came up with the idea of making a boilerplate for it that I can easily change when I need too.

### Built With

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)
- [MaterialKitProReact](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit-pro-react/#/documentation/tutorial)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

- mongo
  Make sure you have mongo installed locally or have access to a cloud database like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adam-spice/mernplate.git
```

2. Change into the cloned folder

```sh
cd mernplate
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm run install:all
```

The above command will install all the packages for the both the server and client.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To start the app in dev mode run

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the express server and the create-react-app development server using concurrently

To start in production mode run

```sh
npm start
```

This will build an optimized version of the client in the build folder and then start the express server
